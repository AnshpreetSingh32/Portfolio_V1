# Anshpreet Singh - Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. This project is a showcase of my skills, professional experience, and projects, built with a modern and responsive tech stack.


## ‚ú® Features

- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **Fully Responsive**: A clean and accessible design that works seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: User-friendly theme switcher that respects system preferences, powered by `next-themes`.
- **Smooth Animations**: Engaging and fluid animations throughout the site using `Framer Motion`.
- **Dynamic Content**: Project, skill, and experience data are loaded from a central file (`src/app/utils/data.ts`), making content updates simple and quick.
- **Interactive UI**: Features like a typewriter effect in the hero section, animated skill icons, and custom-styled buttons with hover effects.
- **Functional Contact Form**: Integrated with **EmailJS** to send messages directly from the portfolio to my inbox.
